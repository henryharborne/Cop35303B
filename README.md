Recommended to run this code on Jupyter Notebooks through Anaconda Navigator. dataset.csv will need to be in the same folder or data won't be read properly.

Will need to have the following libraries installed (library imports occur in Cell 1, so program will not be able to run unless they are installed):
	Pandas
 	Numpy
  	sklearn
   	Matplotlib

This program compares two ML algorithms (KNN and Naive Bayes, both implemented from scratch). Previous coursework in EEL4930 - Applied Machine Learning Systems and CIS4930 - Intro to Machine Learning were used as references to help facilitate Data Exploration, Data Preprocessing, and Comparison Visualization.

This program gets the user to select a song from the dataset, and using KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms, recommends 3 songs from each algorithm. Euclidean Distance is used as the comparison metric to determine the most closely linked song. Cosine Similarity, Manhattan Distance, Hamming Distance, and Correlation Distance are used as additional ways of visualizing the results.
